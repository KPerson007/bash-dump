# CSE 12 Helper Scripts
 I wrote these scripts to help me do and test my homework for CSE 12 @ UCSD easier.
### keepalive
 keepalive is a script that can keep an ssh session to the UCSD server from timing out, useful if you're editing code in one session and testing in another and you want to prevent the testing session from timing out.
### test
 test is a script that will test driver code from your assignment against the provided solution executable. Note, you may have to change the file path template depending on the name of the driver programs and where they are located. Pass at least 2 arguments: the driver number (1 for driver #1, 2 for driver #2, etc), and one or more files to use as the standard input (it will test all given files).
